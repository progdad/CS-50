# **Understanding Computer Science Fundamentals**

## **Binary Representation**
- Computers process information using electrical signals represented by **binary code**: 0s and 1s.
- A **"bit"** stands for **"binary digit,"** and it's the **smallest unit** in computing.

## **Bytes and ASCII**
- Information is represented using **"bytes,"** each consisting of **8 bits**.
- **ASCII** is a **character encoding standard** that uses numeric codes to represent characters in computers.
- For example, the character **"A"** in the **ASCII table** is represented as the **decimal number 65**, which later translates to binary as **"01000001."**
- **ASCII** was originally designed for English characters and control characters, it includes letters, numbers, punctuation, and various special symbols.
- **ASCII** uses 7 bits to represent each character, providing a total of 128 unique characters.

## **Unicode**
- **Unicode** is a character encoding standard designed to represent text and symbols from all writing systems of the world.
- **Unicode** extends character representation to cover a wide range of languages and symbols.
- It uses **more than 8 bits** to represent characters, allowing for a **broader character set.**. It uses a variable-length encoding, allowing for up to 32 bits to represent each character.
- **Unicode is backward compatible with ASCII**, meaning that the first 128 characters in Unicode are identical to the ASCII character set.

## **Colors and Pixels**
- A **pixel** is **the smallest unit** of a digital image, representing a single color. When combined, pixels form the complete image.
- A **higher number of pixels** results in **higher-quality images.** And each pixel represents a single color.
- **Colors** are created by combining some amount of **red, green, and blue (RGB)**. Each pixel typically weights 24 bits, 1 byte for each color. - Each **byte** of **red, green, or blue** represents the **intensity of the color.**
- **Videos** consist of sequences of images, and **"FPS"** refers to **frames per second.**

## **Problem Solving**
- Computer scientists tackle problems by breaking them into **three steps: "input -> algorithm -> output."**
- Different **file types**, such as **.jpg, .txt, and .mp3,** address **distinct problems**, processing various inputs and generating **different outputs.**
- Efficient solutions are sought using **algorithms**. An example of an algorithm is **"binary search" algorithm** for sorted lists.

## **Algorithms: The Heart of Computer Programs**
- **Algorithms** form the **core** of what a program does, providing **step-by-step instructions** for the efficient and consistent handling of incoming data.
- They **abstract the underlying complexity**, making users unaware of what's happening underneath the hood.
- Efficient algorithms are essential for **solving problems optimally** and **delivering timely results.**
- Algorithms consist of **repeating steps (loops), condition checks, and functions/methods.** <br>
**For more information refer to [more notes on algorithms](./../4_Algorithms/theory4.md).*

## **Events and Functions**
- **Events**, often triggered by user actions, are **handled by functions/methods.**
- **Functions/methods** are the **building blocks** of computer programs. They encapsulate a series of instructions to **perform specific tasks** or **solve particular problems.**
- These abstractions make it **easier to manage complex code** and ensure that the right actions are taken in response to various events.

## **Programs and Applications**
- **Programs** and **applications** are **collections of problems** solved through **functions/methods** triggered by events.
- **User actions** trigger events, generating **distinct input**, resulting in **specific outputs.**
- Input can vary from **user interactions** to **retrieved information.**

In computer science, understanding these **fundamental concepts**, along with the **critical role of algorithms**, is **key** to **mastering problem-solving and programming.**
