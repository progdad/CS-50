# Notes on CS50

***Disclaimer:*** While the notes **encompass a significant portion of the course material**, please take into account that **certain topics are omitted**, and some sections include both **theoretical insights** and **code examples** that **extend beyond the course's scope**. I've excluded what I considered to be redundant and added some content that, in my opinion, adds to a more comprehensive understanding.

**The repository consists of theoretical notes** formatted in markdown, and simple **practical examples** to them in all the languages used in this course: **C**, **Python**, **SQL**, **HTML** and **JS**.  
[View the full content table](./TheBasicsCourse/README.md) for a comprehensive overview of all notes.

**If you come across any** typos, issues, inaccuracies, or mistakes, **feel free to contribute** to the repository. I appreciate and will review all suggested changes.

.

**The basics-related notes are organized in the [TheBasicsCourse](./TheBasicsCourse/) directory, anticipating the addition of potential future CS50 courses to this repository.*
