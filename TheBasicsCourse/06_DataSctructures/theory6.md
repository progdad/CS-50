# Queues and Stacks

**Queues** are linear data structures that adhere to the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are added to the rear and removed from the front (enqueue, dequeue) for applications like task scheduling.

**Stacks** are linear data structures that adhere to the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, with elements added to and removed from the top, and the option to view the top (push, pop, peek).

# Linked Lists

In C, a **linked list** is a data structure used to store a collection of elements where each element, called a "node," contains both the data and a reference (or a pointer) to the next node in the sequence. Indexing is not possible with linked lists, as it works only with arrays, elements of which are contiguous.

# Trees

**Tree**: A hierarchical data structure in which nodes are linked by references or pointers, indicating parent-child relationships and defining the structure of the tree.

**Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A specific type of tree in which nodes have up to two children, connected through references or pointers, optimized for efficient searching, sorting, and hierarchical representation.

# Dictionary Data Type

**Dictionary Data Type**: Stores key-value pairs for quick data retrieval and storage, using unique keys to access associated values.

# Hashing

**Hashing** is the process of converting data into a fixed-size value using a hash function. It is used to enable rapid data retrieval and efficient storage in various computer science applications, such as databases, data structures, and encryption.

**Hash Function**: A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that converts input data into a fixed-size output (hash code). It is essential for indexing, searching, and data storage. A good hash function ensures quick and reliable data access while minimizing collisions (different inputs producing the same hash code).
