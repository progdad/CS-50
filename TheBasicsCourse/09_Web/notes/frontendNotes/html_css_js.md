# Frontend, HTML, CSS, JS

- **Frontend** refers to the part of a web application or a website that **users interact with directly**. It includes the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). **HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language), **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets), and **JavaScript** play key roles in frontend development. HTML structures the semantic content, CSS styles the visual presentation, and JavaScript adds interactivity, making web pages dynamic.

- **Backend is the server-side** of a web application that handles **behind-the-scenes operations and data processing**. It includes the **server, database, and application logic**. Programming languages like Python, Ruby, Java, or Node.js are commonly used for backend development. The backend receives requests from the frontend, processes data, interacts with databases, and sends responses back to the frontend.

## HTML (HyperText Markup Language):

- **HTML** is the **standard markup language** used to create the structure and content **of web pages**. It consists of a series of **elements**, each represented by **tags**, that define the structure and content of a document.

- The **HTML tree** refers to the hierarchical structure of HTML elements in a document, forming **a tree-like arrangement**. **Each HTML element is a node in this tree**, and elements can be nested within one another, creating **parent-child relationships**. The root `<html>` element encapsulates the entire document.

- **In the memory** of a computer, the **HTML document** is stored and represented as a **tree structure**, known as the **Document Object Model (DOM)**. This model organizes HTML elements into a tree hierarchy, with each node in the tree corresponding to an element, attribute, or piece of text in the HTML document.

### HTML Code Structure

- HTML code structure consists of two parts: **head** and **body**.

  - The `<head>` HTML element contains machine-readable information (metadata) about the document, like its title, scripts, style sheets, etc. For that, we use `<meta>`, `<link>`, `<title>`, and other types of tags.

  - The `<body>` section holds the actual content of the webpage.

## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

- **CSS** is another **essential component in web development**, serving as a **style language** designed to facilitate the aesthetic presentation of web pages. Selectors in CSS target HTML elements for styling.

## JS (JavaScript)

- **JavaScript is a full-fledged programming language specifically crafted for web development**. It enhances website interactivity by **dynamically manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM)**, allowing developers to add, remove, or modify HTML elements and their content.

- Additionally, **JavaScript incorporates built-in functions that respond to user interactions**, enabling developers to handle events like clicks or form submissions. This responsiveness facilitates the creation of dynamic and engaging web applications. JavaScript is often used to **fetch data asynchronously** from servers, enabling dynamic content updates without page reloads. It plays a crucial role in **event-driven programming**, responding to user actions and interactions.
